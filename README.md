### Hello! I'm Randi! Thanks for checking out what I like to do most! Here you'll find a collection of projects I've worked on from my early coding days to now!

- I began my coding adventure in high school when I discovered ti-basic. The programming language on TI graphing calculators!
- In my non coding time I enjoy playing hockey, drumming, hiking, or relaxing with my pup at home.

# Some of my favorite languages to work with:
- Java
- JavaScript
- Typescript
- c#
- Kotlin

I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to send me an email at egan.randal@gmail.com
